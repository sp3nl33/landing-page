# landing-page
This is a project from TOP. The main goal is to create a landing page based on the provided example (01.png) using HTML and CSS, Flexbox in particular.

In this project, I mainly used flexbox to adequately organize things in neat blocks for a total of 5.5 sections (the .5 represents the header, which is a little bit like its own section). 

The entire body is displayed as a flexbox with the orientation as a column.

The header is a flexbox made up of two flexboxes with content in them. The first block also contains two flexboxes with content in them, separated into a text container and a picture container.

The second block is made up of multiple flexboxes with content in them, and the pictures are clickable to take you to a song that corresponds with your selection. The boxes are a container, and the text is also in a container.

The third block is also made up of multiple flexboxes with simple text in them.

The fourth block is made up of one container that has two smaller containers with text on one side and a button on the other. 

Finally, the last block is a simple footer with centered text.


This was a fun project to make that was actually a lot easier than I thought it'd be. Once I had the basics down, I went ahead and had some fun with the page. I'm a big vaporwave fan, so I tried to model the page in that aesthetic and incorporate some humor as well. Getting to use something I like in my code made the project feel like a blast instead of work.

The only downside I can think of is that I was unable to center my text in the third block directly under the boxes. However, the current look actually does fit the aesthetic, so I will opt to keep it. I will still have to come back to this project and tinker with it so I can figure it out, but that's for a later time.

I learned how to import a new font, and this was the first time I had clickable pictures in a project. While I am no master at flex or spacing, I feel like I got a better grasp of the concepts on this project.
